Homework assignment 1
The code base for this website has been refactored to improve accessibility & SEO by replacing div elements with semantic elements, including alt attributes and tabindex.
A meta tag description was add and img alt descriptions were included to utilise relevant keyword in order to optimise the webpage for search engines.
The code base has also been simplified to combine some classes where they did not need to be unique.
I changed the hero image from a background image in the CSS to a html element so that the user could navigate to it via the keyboard and read an alt description.
